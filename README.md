# DealScope

## AI-Powered M&A Due Diligence Platform

**Multi-Model Orchestration • Transparent Reasoning • Consensus Intelligence**

DealScope orchestrates Claude, GPT-4, and Gemini together for deeper, more reliable M&A analysis.

## 🎯 Why DealScope?

Single AI models have blind spots. DealScope uses **three models in parallel**:

| Model | Strength | Used For |
|-------|----------|----------|
| **Claude** | Nuanced reasoning | Contract analysis, risk assessment |
| **GPT-4** | Mathematical precision | Financial modeling, valuations |
| **Gemini** | Fast retrieval | Document search, market research |

**When models agree = high confidence. When they disagree = investigate further.**

## ✨ Features

- **Multi-Agent Analysis**: 3 AI agents analyze documents simultaneously
- **Consensus Engine**: Synthesizes findings across models
- **Reasoning Streams**: Watch AI think in real-time
- **Agent Debate Arena**: AI argues for/against positions
- **Intelligent Routing**: Auto-routes tasks to best model
- **Audit Trail**: SOC 2 compliant logging

## 🔑 Key Differentiator

This is NOT an API wrapper. DealScope provides:

1. **Intelligent task routing** to optimal models
2. **Cross-validation** between models
3. **Consensus scoring** across findings
4. **Transparent reasoning** visible to users
5. **Adversarial debate** for stress-testing
